# Abstract

Rapid response to a victim of an accident or feel unwell is factors to save this person. The
problem here is the response time of the emergency doctor and first aider is often very slow,
because of time spent in the roads. While every minute that passes increases the risk of
serious consequences and human deaths.

On one hand, a quick transportation of the first medical tool and drugs is very important and
on the other hand the distance support of a specialist is essential. An estimated 20% of
untrained people would be able to use first aid tools and medicines. With the instructions of
emergency physicians that percentage could rise to 90%.

To resolve this problem we propose a quick medical aid system. It consists of a website and
an android application. The website is used to connect hospitals, provide common medical
record, allow a hospital to ask for a medical resources and request a blood donation.

The application is used in emergency cases either to ask for a drone with medical aids that
goes to the request location or to get online help depending on the sender first impression
about the injured person.
